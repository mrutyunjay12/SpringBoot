## Course Overview

### Introduction
Developing your first Spring Boot Web Application is fun.

Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can “just run”. We take an opinionated view of the Spring platform and third-party libraries so you can get started with minimum fuss. Most Spring Boot applications need very little Spring configuration.

In this course, you will learn the basics developing a Basic Todo Management Application using Spring Boot with Login and Logout functionalities.

You will build the website step by step - in more than 25 steps. This course would be a perfect first step as an introduction to Java Web Application Development.

You will be using Spring (Dependency Management), Spring MVC, Spring Boot, Spring Security (Authentication and Authorization), BootStrap (Styling Pages), Maven (dependencies management), Eclipse (IDE) and Tomcat Embedded Web Server. We will help you set up each one of these.

You will learn about
- Basics of Spring Boot
- Basics of Autoconfiguration and Spring Boot Magic
- DispatcherServlet
- Basic Todo Management Application with Login/Logout
- Model, Controllers, ViewResolver and Filters
- Forms - DataBinding, Validation
- Annotation based approach - @RequestParam, @ModelAttribute, @SessionAttributes etc
